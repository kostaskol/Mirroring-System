1. Change the content server and add the delay option (only change required in the MirrorServer for this one is to send the ID (that we get from the queue)
2. Remove un-needed code (i.e. we don't need the workers to check the amount of files they will receive since every item on the queue is a file)
3. Organise the code into one directory, create a makefile, add shared libraries
4. TEST TEST TEST TEST with as many different parameters as possible
5. Run it on the linux machine: After cleaning the code and removing any un-needed files, scp it to a linux machine and TEST TEST TEST again
	(Let's get a 100 on this one ;) )
