1. Each mirror manager will push to the queue a string of the following format:
	<LIST command result>:--<server-addr>::-<server-port>:::<id>
	This way, each worker thread knows to what host it should make the connection
2. A LIST command to a content-server will return only paths to files (and not directories).
	This means that we can fetch these files directly
